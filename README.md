# Project-02_Breast_cancer_Prediction_ML_Model
## Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview

This project is a machine learning model for breast cancer prediction using a dataset of diagnostic features. The model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97%, providing a reliable tool for detecting breast cancer based on input features.which surpassing the industry benchmarks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

1.Radius

2.Texture

3.Perimeter

4.Area

5.Smoothness

6.Compactness

7.Concavity

8.Concave Points

9.Symmetry

10.Fractal Dimension

Each sample is labeled as either Malignant (1) or Benign (0).

## Model & Performance:-

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier (or specify the model used)

Accuracy Achieved: 97%

## Evaluation Metrics:

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

## Steps for Logistic Regression Model

## Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset.

Handle missing values if any.

Standardize features for better model performance.

## Splitting Data:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% train, 30% test).

## Model Training:

Train the Logistic Regression model using the training set.

Optimize hyperparameters if necessary.

## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Generate a confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Prediction:

Provide new patient data to the trained model.

The model will output whether the Breast Cancer is Malignant or Benign
