Breast Cancer Prediction

#Overview

This project is a machine learning model for breast cancer prediction using a dataset of diagnostic features. The model achieves an accuracy of 97%, providing a reliable tool for detecting breast cancer based on input features.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

Features

The dataset includes the following features:

Radius

Texture

Perimeter

Area

Smoothness

Compactness

Concavity

Concave Points

Symmetry

Fractal Dimension

Each sample is labeled as either Malignant (1) or Benign (0).
